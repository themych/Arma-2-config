# Arma 2 config
This repository contains my configs for Arma 2.

### Changes
- WASD replaced with godlike ESDF;
- FOV adjusted to 100° (this works only for 1920×1080, google ‘Arma 2 FOV Adjustment’ if you have a different screen resolution);
- Mouse sensitivity reduced to ½ of its minimal value

### TODO
- Hold to aim;
- Remove view controls from num keys and fill them with something not completely useless, thus freeing alphabetical keys;
